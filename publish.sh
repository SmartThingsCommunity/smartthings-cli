# Currently using lerna publish locally with interactive confirmation until we are confident
# enough to add to CI/CD.
#
# Requirements to run:
# 1. lerna installed
# 2. smartthingspi Github PAT environment variable set "export GH_TOKEN=pi-token-here"
# 3. npm login as smartthingspi
# 4. local master is up to date with upstream and no changes have been committed on top
#
# All configuration not shown in commands here is set in lerna.json under "command.publish" or release-it.yaml.
# Once we are out of pre-release, if we are still using release-it to update releases with binaries, we'll need
# to set "preRelease: false". If we are still using lerna, "command.publish.conventionalPrerelease" and
# "command.publish.preid" should be removed. Further one-time lerna commands will be needed to "graduate" packages out of pre.
#
# See https://github.com/lerna/lerna/blob/f6e7a13e60fefc523d701efddfcf0ed41a77749b/commands/version/README.md#prerelease
